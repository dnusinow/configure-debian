configure-debian (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * I rewrote large portions of configure-debian based on the tasksel
    rewrite.  It now uses debconf through an external shell script, so
    it'll be compatible with cdebconf if need be. It should also avoid the
    weird gnome debconf frontend bugs that have popped up in earlier
    versions. Any frontend-specific bugs are now bugs in the frontend
    itself, not configure-debian. After some testing, I hope to put the
    program in to debconf itself (named configure-packages) but not until
    I'm comfortable with its stability.

configure-debian (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This will be the last of the major changes before sarge. Anything
    else will just be updated and new translations. A quick apology to
    the translators, I'm sorry that I've been changing my templates so
    much, but the program is basically in its final form right now.
    Everything else will be just brand new templates for new apps, but
    those won't show up until after sarge is released.
