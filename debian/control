Description: central configuration program for packages using debconf
 configure-debian is a program which presents a list of packages which
 use Debconf, Debian's configuration management system.
 .
 Debconf provides first-time installation wizards that run when a
 package is installed. You may reconfigure these packages at a later 
 time, if you wish, and configure-debian makes that very easy.
 .
 configure-debian splits the package lists into the subsections which 
 make up the Debian archive, such as x11, base, gnome, or kde.
