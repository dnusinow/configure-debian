This program is meant to be a simple frontend to the dpkg-reconfigure
program. Many new users who do not know about this program are unaware
of how to return to the debconf configuration seen during package
install. Others who do know about it often forget or do not know the
package name of the program they want to reconfigure. This program is
meant to address both of those issues.

Note that this is not meant to be a complete configuration system!
Debconf is a purposely simple system, and is not meant to solve all
configuration needs. Still, it is very flexible and can accomplish a
lot with relative ease.
